    "Cigarette smoking causes one-third of all cancer deaths in the United States. It is associated with adverse health outcomes such as second primary cancers among cancer patients and survivors. Smoking also causes non-cancer diseases such as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Smokers are at an increased risk of developing diseases such as diabetes and have worse symptoms and outcomes associated with health conditions such as asthma and obesity than nonsmokers. Involuntary exposure to smoke is associated with increased risk of tobacco-related diseases such as stroke and lung cancer among nonsmokers. Overall, smoking causes 480000 premature deaths, 50000 secondhand smoking-related deaths, and 12.7 million medical conditions annually. Economic costs because of lost productivity are at $151 billion due to premature death and $5.6 billion due to secondhand smoker. Total annual economic loss for 2009-12 was estimated at $289-332.5 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is a platform for health-related information. Further, geo-tagging allows researchers to identify geographical regions where smoking cessation tweets are predominant. Research shows that exposure to health information on social media has been associated with health behavior. The primary goal of this project is to examine the volume and content of smoking cessation tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the volume of favored and retweeted tweets overall and by state. Further, I aim to conduct textual analysis on most favored and/or retweeted tweets to understand the valence of the tweets. "
